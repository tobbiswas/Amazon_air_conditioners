# 🧊 Amazon Product Analysis with SQL (PostgreSQL)

## 📌 Project Overview

This mini project is a SQL-based analysis of an air conditioner product dataset using **PostgreSQL**. The goal is to extract meaningful business insights related to product ratings, pricing, discounts, and category trends using SQL queries.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **PostgreSQL**
- **SQL** (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, LIMIT, AVG, COUNT, etc.)

## 🎯 Key Objectives

- Identify top-rated and most reviewed air conditioners
- Analyze discount patterns and pricing strategies
- Group products by subcategory for inventory insights
- Discover unrated or underperforming products
- Compare average ratings by subcategory

## 📄 SQL Queries Included

1. **Top 5 Most Rated Products**
2. **Products with Rating Above 4.5**
3. **Average Discount Percentage**
4. **Product Count by Subcategory**
5. **Cheapest 5 Air Conditioners**
6. **Most Expensive Products**
7. **Unrated Products**
8. **Total Products & Average Price**
9. **Average Ratings per Subcategory**
10. **Products with >1000 Ratings and Rating Above 4.3**

## 📊 Sample Insight

> The average discount percentage across all products is calculated to assess marketing effectiveness, and products with over 1000 ratings and high average scores help identify bestsellers for promotional campaigns.

## 🔍 Dataset Structure (Sample Columns)

- `NAME` – Product Name  
- `ACTUAL_PRICE` – Original Price  
- `DISCOUNT_PRICE` – Discounted Price  
- `RATINGS` – Average Customer Rating

## 📈 Outcome

This project strengthened my SQL querying skills and helped me interpret product-level insights that can aid decision-making in marketing, procurement, or eCommerce operations.
